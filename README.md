# analysys_meat_consumption_lung_cancer_deaths_romania
This experiment tries to identify whether a correlation can be established between the meat consumption per capita and the number of lung cancer deaths in Romania over a period of 28 years. The input consists of two data sets, one about cancer deaths by type and one about meat consumption per capita per category (poultry, pigmeat etc). The output consists of a newly created data set based on the processed data from the input ones and two visualizations that help us examine whether the correlation exists or not, which are interpreted.
